# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to show trends in school performance and sort all of the grades of the standardized tests to help get each school the correct funding. We used Jupyter Notebook along with pandas to clean up the data and sort all of the grades out. When all of the grades were sorted out I used Jupyter Notebook to display the data so it could easily be read and understood by everyone who looked at it. 

# Results

# Summary
After removing the grades that had been altered the average grades did go down but not by enough to change much. Thomas high school is still in the top five high schools by grades. The biggest change would be for ninth grade at thomas high school because all of those grades have been removed.
